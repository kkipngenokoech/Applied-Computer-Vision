In linear algebra, vectors are fundamental objects used to represent points, directions, and transformations in vector spaces. They serve as building blocks for understanding vector operations, such as addition, scalar multiplication, and dot product, which are essential for solving systems of linear equations and finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n\nIn machine learning, vectors are pervasive, representing features and data points in numerical form. They enable efficient storage and computation, allowing algorithms to handle large datasets effectively. Vector spaces are central to dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and SVD, helping extract essential features and reduce noise. Moreover, similarity measures between vectors aid in clustering and classification tasks, and neural networks, fundamental to modern machine learning, heavily rely on vector-based operations for training and inference.
